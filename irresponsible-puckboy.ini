comment=<p><b>TRIPP</b></p> <p>The worst part of being in love with my straight best friend is the fact he’s too oblivious to see it. </p> <p>Years of pining have left me exhausted, and I need a break from Dex. I need space to get over my feelings. But when his relationship falls apart and he turns to me for comfort, I cave immediately. </p> <p>If there’s one thing I hate more than being hurt, it’s seeing Dex struggle. I can’t leave him in a time of need, even if my friends say it’s my biggest downfall. </p> <p>They say Dexter Mitchale is my weakness, but if that’s true, I don’t want to be strong.</p> <p><b>DEX</b></p> <p>I’ve always been the dumb one. It’s what I’m known for, and usually I don’t let it get to me.</p> <p>I have hockey, and I have my best friend, Tripp. What more do I need? To settle down? No thank you. Marriage? Hard pass. According to ex-girlfriends, that makes me “irresponsible”. </p> <p>But the solution I come up with to get over my fear of commitment might be my dumbest idea yet. Not only does it have team management breathing down my neck, but it puts a strain on my friendship with Tripp.</p> <p>This PR nightmare could lose me the only person I’ve ever loved. Losing girlfriends is nothing. Losing Tripp? It’s not an option.</p> <p>I’ll do whatever it takes to keep him.</p>
