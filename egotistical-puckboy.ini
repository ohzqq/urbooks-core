comment=<p><b>Ezra</b></p> <p>Partying, dudes, and hockey. What more could a gay NHL player want?</p> <p>If it weren&#39;t for Anton Hayes, my life would be perfect.</p> <p>Not that he affects my life in any way. At all. That would imply I care what the winger from Philly thinks of me.</p> <p>Which I don&#39;t.</p> <p>Not even a one-night stand with him can thaw his misplaced animosity toward me.</p> <p>He says I&#39;m the one with the ego, but he can talk. He rivals me for most egotistical puck boy in the league.</p> <p>I hate him as much as he hates me. Even if I crave a repeat.</p> <p><b>Anton</b></p> <p>When it comes to hockey, I&#39;m all about the game.</p> <p>I&#39;ve worked for years to be one of the best in the league, and l&#39;ve done it without splashing my orientation all over the tabloids.</p> <p>My hockey image is one I&#39;ve carefully cultivated, and after one night with Ezra Palaszczuk, I risk it all.</p> <p>He&#39;s cocky, obnoxious, and has an ego bigger than Massachusetts. And okay, maybe he&#39;s the sexiest man I&#39;ve ever known.</p> <p>We&#39;ll never get along. Not when we sleep together. Not even when my possessive streak awakens.</p> <p>That doesn&#39;t stop us from falling into bed together over and over again.</p>
